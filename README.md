### Armor Value and Dodge Value (AV / DV)
    Your armor value 🔷(AV) is a measurement of how well protected you are against physical attacks that hit you.
    The highers your score, the less likely an opponent's attacks will do severe damage to you.
    Most characters start with a base AV score of 0.

### Electrical Resist

##  Skills and Powers
    Your skills and powers represent the abilities you have learned in your life.
    Each skill has several powers associated with it.
    You begin with several powers determined by your caste or calling.
    You may purchase other powers by spending skill points which you earn when you gain a level
    *The higher your intelligence score the more skill points you earn.

    To purchase a new power, you must first purchase the skill with wchich that power is associated.
    You mush meet any attribute or power requirements of the skill or power you are trying to purchase.
    *It is possible to have access to certain powers without having the associated skills through caste or calling.

    Powers often grant you activated abilities.
##  Mutations and Defects
    Mutations are special powers either biological or metaphysical gifted to denizens of this world.
    Some creatures do not possess any mutation.
    There are two types of mutations: Physical and Mental. Each Mutation has a mutation score associated with it.
    The scores of your physical mutations and their cooldowns of activated abilities are static.
    The scores of your mental mutations are augmented by your Ego modifier.
    The cooldowns of abilities granted by your mental mutations are modulated by 5% for each point of Willpower you possess above or below 16.

    Most characters begin with mutation scores of 1. You earn a mutation point when you gain a new level.
    You may spend mutation points to augment the score of one of your mutations by 1.
    The mutation score of none of your mutations may exceed 1 plus your character level divided by 2.
    Mutations may only be augmented by mutations points up to a maximum score of 10.
    Mental mutations may exceed this score if your Ego further augments them beyond 10.
    There is an additional 'Glimmer' score which represents how powerful a creature's mental capablilities are, or how noticeable.
    Glimmer score is calculated by summing up all of the creature's mental mutation levels, plus other effects (this inclueds levels from a high Ego)

    Alternatively, you may spend 4 mutation points to choose a new mutation from three randomly selected mutations.
    The mutation you choose begins with a score of 1.
    If you are a chimera, you are offered a choice of physical mutations.
    If you are an esper, you are offered mental mutations.
    Otherwise, you are offered three completely random mutations.
    Mutations often grant you activated abilities.

    Defects are mutations with primarily negative effects. Certain mutants begin with a single defect.
    There is no score associated with defects.
##  Artifacts
    Artifacts are items so technologically complex or otherwise beyond normal comprehension that few of this world understand them.
    An unidentified artifact will appear to you as a 'Weird artifact'.
    You may examine an artifact to try to identify it.
    On successful identification, you will narrow down the possibilities of that artifact's function. For example:
    (what was once a 'club' you may now identify as a 'rifle').
    Eventually you may completely identify the artifact.
    Each time you attempt to identify something and fail, however, there is a small chance you will break it.
    Your chance of successfully identifying an artifact is based on your intelligence score.
##  Tonics
    Tonics are chemical concoctions that enchance your mental and physical stats in a variety of ways.
    They are artifacts, and so you must successfully identify them to understand what they do.
    Ingesting one tonic while under the effects of another is dangerous.
    For each new tonic you ingest, there is a greater chance that the tonics will react adversely to each other.
    The higher your Toughness score is, the greater the chance that you will be able to ingest multiple tonics without side-effects.

    Tonics produce more potent effects in those without mutation.
    As the body chemistry of mutants is inherently unstable, there is a 5% chance that a will instead produce a undesired effect.

    Tonics may be concocted with the Tinker skill.
    In addition to Bits, concocting a tonic will always require a natural ingredient.
##  Weapons and Armor
### Weapons
    Every weapon has a penetration value (PV), and a damage value (DV). For example: 🔰4 ❤️1d4
    The penetration value of melee weapons is related to your strength score, though the value is capped based on the material of the weapon.
    Swords and daggers have 🔰PV equal to your streangth score.
    Axes have 🔰PV equal to 1 plus your strength score because they are highly penetrating.
    Cudgels have 🔰PV equal to 2 plus your strength score because they are less dependent on your opponent's armor.
    Missile weapons have static penetration values that do not change based on your strength score.
    Weapons may modify other statistics.
### Armor
    Most pieces of armor have an armor value (AV), and a dodge value (DV). For example: 🔷4 🟢4
    The values armor provide will augment your own 🔷AV and 🟢DV (see *Attributes*).
    Pieces of armor may modify other statistics.
##  Combat
### Melee Combat
    Melee combat is combat between two adjacent opponents with standard melee weapons such as swords, daggers, axes, and clubs.
    When you make a melee attack against a target, the following sequence of events occurs:
1.  Determine whether or not you hit the target.
    Your to-hit roll is 1d20 plus your agility modifier plus any bonues you recieve from your weapon or skill powers.
    If this roll exceed yours opponent's dodge value 🟢(DV), then you hit.
2.  Determine how severely your attack penetrates your target's armor.
    Each weapon has a penetration value (🔰4, for example).
    This value represents the armor value 🔷(AV) that your weapon will usually penetrate with ease.
    If your weapon's penetration value far exceeds your target's AV, your weapon will likely penetrate several times.
    Each time your weapon penetrates your target's armor, your target is dealt damage equal to your weapon's damage value (♥1d4, for example).
3.  Determine if multiple attacks are made.
    There is a 15% chance that you make an additional attack with your secondary hand.
    Characters with multiple limbs, hand-to-hand training, or otherwise through magical effect may make additional attacks beyond this.
### Missile Combat
    Missile combat is combat between two opponents with missile weapons such as bow, pistols, and rifles.
    If you are engaged in melee combat with more than one hostile opponent, there is a 50% chance that each missile attack you make goes wild.
    When you make a missile attack, the following sequence of events occurs:
1.  Determine the trajectory of your missile.
    How far a missile is likely to veer from its projected path is determined by your agility score and the weapons's accuracy.
2.  Hit the first medium-sized or larger object along the missile's trajectory.
3.  Determine how severely the missile penetrates your target's armor.
    This is resolved in the same way as a melee attack.
4.  Determine if multiple attacks are made.
    Certain powers allow you to fire multiple missiles with certain missile weapons.
